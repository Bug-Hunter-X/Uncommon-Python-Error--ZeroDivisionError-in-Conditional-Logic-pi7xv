# Uncommon Python Error: ZeroDivisionError in Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a Python code snippet that produces a `ZeroDivisionError` but only under a specific condition. This makes it an uncommon scenario and a good example of how subtle conditions can lead to runtime errors.

The file `bug.py` contains the buggy code. The file `bugSolution.py` presents a corrected version with improved error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `bug.py` using a Python interpreter. Observe the error.
4. Run `bugSolution.py` to see the corrected version.
